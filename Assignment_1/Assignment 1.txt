Question 1:
	1. ssh scur2371@snellius.surf.nl -> [scur2371@int4 ~]$ (see screenshot)
	2. I had no issues.
	3. My version of ssh:

	   PS C:\Users\diede> ssh -v
           usage: ssh [-46AaCfGgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-B bind_interface] [-b bind_address]
           [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file]
           [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file]
           [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec]
           [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-P tag] [-p port] [-Q query_option]
           [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]]
           destination [command [argument ...]]
	
	   I have prior experience with SSH because of WebTech previous year.
	   I did not take preemptive steps, because I assumed it would work.

Question 2:
	1. See my screenshots for each task I uploaded a screenshot. Path to venv: /gpfs/home5/scur2371/venv.
	2. It took approximately half a minute to install pytorch and it begin installing.
	   The size of the venv folder is 6.7G
	3. When I imported matplotlib, it didn't recognise te package, so I pip installed it after module loading in the venv.
    4. (venv) [scur2371@int4 ~]$ python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}'); print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
	   PyTorch: 2.9.1+cu128
	   CUDA available: False

	   It says that PyTorch is installed and that CUDA in not available. This makes sense because I did install PyTorch and did not request GPU usage.

Question 3:
	1. https://github.com/MxDiederick/MLOps
	2. I Used VSC to commit, pull and push which works flawlessly. Adding to that, I use github quite frequent so I'm familiar working with it.
	   (I did not bump into problems)
	3. You can acces my .gitignore file by copy-pasting the github link I gave.
		- Important things to include are all the files you want to not be seen by the public
		- No, others shouldn't be able to acces snellius.
	4. PS C:\Users\Diederick\assignment_1> git log --oneline

Question 4
	1. [scur2371@int6 Assignment_1]$ sbatch q4.job
	   sbatch: Single-node jobs run on a shared node by default. Add --exclusive if you want to use a node exclusively.
	   sbatch: A full node consists of 128 CPU cores, 229376 MiB of memory and 0 GPUs and can be shared by up to 64 jobs.
	   sbatch: By default shared jobs get 1792 MiB of memory per CPU core, unless explicitly overridden with --mem-per-cpu, --mem-per-gpu or --mem.
	   sbatch: You will be charged for 16 CPUs, based on the number of CPUs and the amount memory that you've requested.
	   Submitted batch job 18211544
